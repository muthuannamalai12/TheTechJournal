Hello Everyone I am currently pursuing a bachelor's in Computer Science Engineering, with an active interest in Web Development and Technical Writing. I am also an upbeat and ambitious person with proven leadership capabilities, who likes to take initiative and seek out new challenges.

I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. I am always looking for an opportunity to do better and achieve greatness.

I'm also passionate about contributing to open-source projects, and enthusiastic about participating in Hackathons because it is a fantastic learning opportunity, It forces me to get out of my comfort zone and grow, also It helps me to network with relevant people.

I'm a problem-solver at heart, highly teachable and eager to learn new skills, fun to work with, have a killer work ethic, and above all, extremely curious and ask a lot of questions.
